## Overview
### Fog of War Chess
[Fog of War Chess]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_chess ) (aka. Dark Chess) is a variant of chess. It is named so due to its characteristic of incomplete information - your chess piece types are invisible to your opponent; they can only see their own chess pieces and which positions are taken, and vice versa.

### Prerequisite
Please refer to [`requirements.txt`]( ./requirements.txt ). Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install them all. The working versions of them are:
```
python-chess==3.10.9     # 3.11.2 won't work
stable-baselines3==2.6.0
sb3_contrib==2.6.0
gym==0.26.0
numpy==1.26.4
torch==2.4.1             # +cu121
pygame==2.6.1
```

The coding environment is mainly on `Windows-10-10.0.22631-SP0`. But Ubuntu/Debian with kernel `Linux-6.1.0` (e.g. Debian 12) should also work.
